Data Analysis and Sorting PROGRAM

C++ program that demonstrates various functions and templates for data analysis and sorting. It includes functions for displaying data, calculating averages, counting the number of males and females, finding elements above a specific threshold, and determining maximum values within arrays. The program also features a sorting algorithm to sort arrays based on a specified criterion, in this case, the height of individuals. The main function showcases the application of these functions on datasets containing information such as age, coffee consumption, gender, and height for a group of people.


Data Analysis and Statistics PROGRAM

C++ program that demonstrates various functions and templates for data analysis and statistics. It includes functions for counting the number of elements exceeding specific thresholds, finding minimum and maximum values within arrays, and calculating the averages of arrays. The program focuses on data related to age, height, and weight for a group of people. It displays the data, counts the number of adults based on age, identifies individuals meeting certain height and weight criteria, finds the minimum and maximum values for each data type, and calculates the average age, height, and weight of the group.


Height and Weight Analysis PROGRAM

C++ program focusing on analyzing height and weight data for a group of individuals. It includes functions to count the number of people exceeding specific height and weight thresholds and find the minimum height and weight values within arrays. The program displays the data for height and weight, counts the number of individuals meeting height and weight criteria, and identifies the minimum height and weight values.


Personnel Data Analysis PROGRAM

This C++ program focuses on the analysis of personnel data, including gender, height, and weight. It employs a class called Personne to represent individuals and performs various operations on this data. The program reads data from an external file, calculates statistics, finds specific individuals within the data, and sorts them by a unique identifier (employee number) using the quicksort algorithm. It also demonstrates how to apply dichotomous search to locate individuals by their employee numbers.


Phone Number Digit Analysis PROGRAM

In this C++ program, we perform a detailed analysis of two phone numbers, one associated with the University of Montreal (UdeM) and the other with a person named Jean. The analysis includes extracting specific substrings to format the phone numbers, counting the occurrences of certain digits, verifying digit presence between the two numbers, and identifying the smallest digit in each phone number. Additionally, the program finds and displays both odd and even digits in the phone numbers. It offers insights into the composition of the digits in these numbers, providing a comprehensive view of their numerical characteristics.


Employee Data Analysis and Quick Search PROGRAM

This C++ program focuses on the analysis of employee data, examining key attributes like gender, employee number, and weekly salary. It starts by reading employee data from a file, and then employs a quicksort algorithm to efficiently sort the employees based on their unique employee numbers. Once the data is sorted, the program performs a binary search to find specific employees by their employee numbers. The result is a structured and sorted view of employee data, which allows for quick and precise searches. The program efficiently combines data analysis with advanced search techniques, offering a useful tool for managing employee records.
