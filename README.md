Data Analysis and Sorting PROGRAM

C++ program that demonstrates various functions and templates for data analysis and sorting. It includes functions for displaying data, calculating averages, counting the number of males and females, finding elements above a specific threshold, and determining maximum values within arrays. The program also features a sorting algorithm to sort arrays based on a specified criterion, in this case, the height of individuals. The main function showcases the application of these functions on datasets containing information such as age, coffee consumption, gender, and height for a group of people.


Data Analysis and Statistics PROGRAM

C++ program that demonstrates various functions and templates for data analysis and statistics. It includes functions for counting the number of elements exceeding specific thresholds, finding minimum and maximum values within arrays, and calculating the averages of arrays. The program focuses on data related to age, height, and weight for a group of people. It displays the data, counts the number of adults based on age, identifies individuals meeting certain height and weight criteria, finds the minimum and maximum values for each data type, and calculates the average age, height, and weight of the group.


Height and Weight Analysis PROGRAM

C++ program focusing on analyzing height and weight data for a group of individuals. It includes functions to count the number of people exceeding specific height and weight thresholds and find the minimum height and weight values within arrays. The program displays the data for height and weight, counts the number of individuals meeting height and weight criteria, and identifies the minimum height and weight values.
